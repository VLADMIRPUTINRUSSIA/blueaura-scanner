Software Requirements
Python:
Version 3.7 or newer.
Python Package Installer (pip):
This typically comes pre-installed with Python.
Python Library Dependencies
These are the libraries that need to be installed via pip. It is highly recommended to put these in a requirements.txt file and install them using the command pip install -r requirements.txt.

playwright: For browser automation and crawling.
pyyaml: To parse the config.yml and payloads.yml files.
jinja2: For generating the final HTML report.
Browser Binaries
This is a critical step that must be performed after installing the Python libraries. The Playwright library needs the actual browser executables to function.

Playwright Browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit):
Install by running the command:
Bash

python -m playwright install
On Linux systems, it is strongly recommended to use the --with-deps flag to automatically install necessary operating system dependencies:
Bash

python -m playwright install --with-deps
Project Files
These are the files that contain the scanner's code, configuration, and attack payloads. You need to create these yourself.

blueaura-scanner.py: The main Python script for the tool.
config.yml: The file to configure the target URL, scanner modules, and other settings.
payloads.yml: The file containing all the payloads for the different scanner modules.
Operating System
The tool is compatible with Linux, Windows, and macOS, as long as Python and the necessary dependencies can be installed.
